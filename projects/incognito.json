  "summary": "Incognito is a layer-1 blockchain that aims to bring privacy to both crypto assets and decentralized applications. We support multi-chain integration via the bridges built to 15+ major blockchains on the market: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB Smart Chain, Binance chain, Monero, Dash, Zilliqa, Zcash, Litecoin, Neo, Tomo chain, Polygon, Fantom, NEAR. Our approach is building a bi-directional bridges to other blockchains so crypto-assets from the blockchains could go back and forth to Incognito easily. Once depositing crypto-assets to Incognito via a bridge, users of the blockchains may benefit from the privacy nature of Incognito transactions which allow them to privately send, receive, or anonymously cross-chain trade crypto. They can also withdraw crypto back to the original blockchain at any time",
